Description: This package provides some subpackages containing classes and functions to analyze time series data.
        
        "time_series_analysis" package contains four main classes
        
        1) data_reader.py:
        Contains DataReader class that reads in a time series data from a flat file
        Data should be in multiple rows per time step data could contain 1 or more columns that evolves in time
        
        2) data_analysis.py:
        Contains DataAnalysis class that inherits reader from DataReader
        Contains functions to compute mean, standard deviation, 
        Contains function to plot time tracy along any dimension
        
        3) convergence_analysis.py:
        Contains function to test convergence using samples along time to test if mean vary
        Can test convergence along one or all dimensions
        
        4) auto_correlation.py:
        Contains AutoCorrelation class that inherits DataReader
        Computes autocorrelation along one or several dimension and reports correlation along time
        
        =======================================================================================================
        
        "test" package 
        Contains unit test of the above classes
        
        For example these tests could be run as follows:
        python -m unittest test.test_data_reader.py
        
        =======================================================================================================
        
        "example" package:
        contains worked out examples 
        
        "example.py" demonstrates how to perform autocorrelation using this tool on a n*m time series data
        where, "n" are samples observed in time and "m" is the dimension of the data
        the code handles 1 to "n" higher dimensional data

        To install the package:
        
        pip install Time-Series-DataAnalysis-Tool==0.1.9
